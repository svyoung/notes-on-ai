            <p>ðŸ“Œ Hello! Just a quick note â€“ this editor doesnâ€™t actually save any notes (YET!); itâ€™s purely for the user interface. What youâ€™re seeing is the <strong><em>Retrieval-Augmented Generation</em></strong> in action, which retrieves the most relevant matches when you perform a search (via the search bar above). Additional notes on various topics will be added periodically to provide more context to the project. </p>
            <p><strong>Some features to expect:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Better similarity comparison with multiple models</li>
                <li>- More data to compare against</li>
                <li>- Infinite scrolling/pagination</li>
                <li>- Notes editing</li>
            </ul>
      </div>
